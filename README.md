TEJAS flight computer is to aid a model rocket with recovery and data logging. It is entirely based on arduino with MPU6050 and BMP280 for orientation and altitude data. The development of TEJAS FC took over 3 months. It was fundamentally designed with no blocking code so as to make it a fault taularent system to some degree.

## Challenges:
-   
-   Low memory
-   Less Processing Power
-   Delayed Apogge Detection
-   Realtime telemetry

### Features of TEJAS 1.0:
-   
-   
-   Systems Check on Boot
-   Non Blocking Code
-   Log Flight Data - Black Box
-   Epic Star Wars Launch sound!
