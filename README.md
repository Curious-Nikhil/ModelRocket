# Software Design
In total there will be two flight controllers. One for LaunchPad and one for the rocket guidance and retrieval. Launchpad computer is fairly simple to design and fabricate. The challenge, however, lies with the Flight Controller.

## Goals
-   Know the orientation
-   Know the Altitude
-   Control the Pyros
-   Control 2 Servo Motor
-   Log Flight Data - Black Box
-   Epic Star Wars Launch sound!


## Challenges:

-   Zero - Fault System
-   Low memory
-   Less Processing Power
